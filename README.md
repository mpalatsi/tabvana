## üîê Permissions Explained

Tabvana requires the following permissions to function:

*   `bookmarks`: To read your bookmark tree (for import and display) and potentially modify bookmarks (if future editing features are added within the extension).
*   `storage`: To save your settings locally (like Unsplash API key, theme preferences, category states, username, search engine choice).
*   `topSites`: To display your most frequently visited websites on the initial view.
*   `tabs`: Used implicitly when opening bookmarks or search results in new tabs.

## üîí Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important. Here's how Tabvana handles your data:

*   **Data Collected & Stored:**
    *   **Settings:** User preferences such as your chosen Unsplash theme, quality setting, username (optional, for greeting), preferred temperature unit, and selected search engine are stored.
    *   **Unsplash API Key:** If you provide an Unsplash API key for dynamic backgrounds, it is stored.
    *   **Bookmark Data:** Information about the categories you create and the bookmarks you add or import (titles, URLs, custom icons if set, favorite status) is stored.
*   **Purpose of Data Collection:** This data is collected solely to provide the features of the extension, such as personalizing the background, greeting you, remembering your layout preferences, managing your bookmarks within the extension, and enabling search.
*   **Data Usage & Storage:** All collected data (settings, API key, bookmark structure) is stored **locally** on your computer using the browser's standard `storage.local` API.
*   **Data Sharing:** Your data is **not shared** with any third parties. It remains on your local machine under your control. Network requests are made only to Unsplash (if API key is provided) to fetch background images and to Google's favicon service (or directly to website servers via `topSites`) to retrieve website icons.
